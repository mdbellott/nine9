nine 9
=====

This is the code for my first app to be published on the iOS App Store.

Nine 9 is a simple number-slider game, with multiple puzzle sizes and modes.

Some Details
=============

This version of the code is a currently unreleased version, in which the code has been updated to take
advanage of Cocos2d v2.0 and above, along with enabling ARC. There remain some changes that still need 
to be made to be ready for iOS 7.

Known Issues:
-In App Purchase (Ad Remover) seem to not be working correctly after the update to Cocos2D v2.x
-GameCenter needs more testing.


Code Availability/ Liscence
===========================

I'm making this code available to the public under a public domain liscence. All that I ask is that if you
choose to use it, copy it, or if you helps you out in any way, please consider dropping me a line at:

I am always happy to receive questions, comments and suggestions.

Thanks,
