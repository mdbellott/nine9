nine 9
=====

This is the code for my first app to be published on the iOS App Store.

Nine 9 is a simple number-slider game, with multiple puzzle sizes and modes.

Some Details
=============

This code is a currently unreleased vesion, in which the app has been updated to take
advanage of Cocos2d v2.0 and above, and enables ARC. There remain some changes that still need 
to be made to be ready for iOS 7.

Known Issues:

-In App Purchase (Ad Remover) seems to not be working correctly after the update to Cocos2D v2.x

-GameCenter needs more testing.

I am making this code available to the public under a public domain license. All that I ask is that if you
choose to use it, copy it, or if you helps you out in any way, please consider dropping me a line at:
